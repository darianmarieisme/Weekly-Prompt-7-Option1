Short-circuiting operators refer to 'and' and 'or' chains because these
types of operators indicate situations where the right side of the expression
may not always be used because it is not needed to be evaluated to make the 
expression 'true'. For example, if you have an expression to check if two things are
true in an 'and' expression, if the first half of the expression comes back as false,
the expression does not need to be evaluated any further. In 'or' expressions, if checking if
either half of the expression is true, if the first half comes back as true, the second
half of the expression does not need to be evaluated.
